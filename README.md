## What is Bitcoin?

What if you could instantly send money permissionlessly and trustlessly to anybody anywhere in the world. What if you could do that for a fraction of the fees that you'd pay your bank. The bank that you have to trust to do the right job in it's own sweet time. The bank you have to trust to keep your information private and not sell it to companies like Facebook. And boy, when did we read the fine print??

Here's another, what if the money that you save actually did retain it's real purchasing power 5, 10, 20 years in the future so that you wouldn't have to always needlessly add zeros in your pay slip. In peace you would be able to follow your passion and not rent out your time in endless servitude.

Bitcoin is that. And Bitcoin is a social experiment on the grandest scale that we have yet managed. Bitcoin in simple terms is a global network for validating transactional information. This information is stored on each and every node in the network forever and cannot be altered for all practical purposes. This enables a trustless decentralised network of value transfer at the speed of light. Think about this for a moment and .. now, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOgFZfRVaww">Imagine</a>.

#### Bitcoin and satoshis

Since bitcoin have become kind of valuable, most people buy fractions of a bitcoin. In the world of lightning, this is typically denominated in satoshis or sats for short. A satoshi is to bitcoin what a cent is to the dollar, but way smaller. There are 100 million satoshis in one bitcon, so you will often operate with tens of thousands of satoshis when you are transacting.
